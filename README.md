# BookCMS

This this project is for a Computer Science Assignment.
Original concept was a credit card validator but there wasn't much substance to that so I landed on bookcms.
Website currently still WIP but java swing gui available with the credit card validation.
(If you reading this now Mr Henney (hi!), will have the site done by the end of the weekend you are reading this.)
